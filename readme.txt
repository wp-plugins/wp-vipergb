Create a stylish and user-friendly Guestbook for your Wordpress blog.  Designed to replicate the appearance and behavior of Viper Guestbook.


== Description ==

WP-ViperGB is a Wordpress plugin designed to replicate the appearance and behavior of the discontinued [Viper Guestbook](http://www.vipergb.de.vu/) project. It makes it easy to add a stylish and user-friendly guestbook to your blog.

Features:

* Create user-friendly guestbooks without writing a single line of code.
* Lives in a standard Wordpress page and uses comments for entries, so moderation and antispam functionality works as normal.
* Two-View layout provides one view for submitting entries and another for reading them.
* Automatic paging of entries to customizable length.
* Allow users to upload and embed images in their signatures.
* Show icons for country, browser, and OS in visitor signatures.
* Admin-panel stylesheet selector allows easy skinning to suit your theme.
* No bloat: Uses existing Wordpress faculties so no custom database tables are required.
* Simple PHP template function allows programmers to manually embed standalone guestbooks in any template they wish.
